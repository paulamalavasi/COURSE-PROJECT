                    <p>The idea behind WFD comes from a place of struggling to figure out what to make for dinner every single night after being tired from working all day.
                    </p>
                    <p>The process consists in taking as input what are some of the ingredients you have on hand and showing you some meals you could put together using what you already have in your pantry.
                    </p>
                    <p>To simplify the process, we divided the meal into two parts, the first being the meal base and subsequently the meal protein.
                    </p>
                    <p>Javascript prompts are being used to ask the user what base and protein are available, and a new tab is opened with a recipe containing those items.
